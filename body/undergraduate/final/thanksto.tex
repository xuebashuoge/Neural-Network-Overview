Being a undergraduate student in Shannon Class is 
lots of fun, and the task in winter holiday greatly enriched 
my knowledge. I want to thank my tutor, Yu Guanding. Yu brought
me into his academic group and revealed me the goal to fight 
for. He is a terrific tutor who gives me freedom to make decisions
and highlights the academic route in the future.
\par It is a fortune to meet graduate student Liu Wenliang. As 
a senior, he provided me sufficient support on getting familiar 
with neural networks. I want to thank Liu for his unfailing help
whenever I have some questions.
\par I want to thank the current learning student Zhou Kaining and 
Li Jiatong for giving me suggestions on the choice of neural 
networks courses, and stimulate me to exert all my power to 
study and research during the holiday.
\par But most of all, I want to express my gratitude to my
family. During the burst of NCP, my parents did a lot to keep
the house clean and cozy. Thank you for your support.
